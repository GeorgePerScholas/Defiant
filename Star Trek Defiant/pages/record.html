		<h2>History</h2>
				<p>The U.S.S. <i>DEFIANT</i> (NX-74205) is a 24th century Federation DEFIANT-class starship operated by Starfleet. This was the prototype of the class and the second Federation ship known to bear the name <i>DEFIANT</i>.</p>
				
				<h3>Origins</h3>
				<p>Development on the <i>DEFIANT</i> began around 2366 in response to the Borg threat to the Federation. After initial and hostile first contact with the Borg, Starfleet did what it hadn't done in decades, place greater emphasis on Starfleet's essential role in the defense of the Federation. Drafting plans for such a defense required a starship capable of fighting against the Borg. The Federation's devastating defeat in the Battle of Wolf 359, resulting in the loss of nearly 40 ships and 11,000 personnel to a single Borg vessel, proved that the Federation's defenses were horribly inadequate, and plans were spearheaded for the production of a more combat capable starship. Officially classified as an escort vessel, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was nothing less than Starfleet's first design of a warship intended to combat the Borg. The vessel featured minimal equipment for scientific research and was not designed to accommodate families.</p>
				<p>The <i>DEFIANT</i> did not perform well in its initial trial runs. The vessel was overpowered and over-gunned for a ship of its size â€“ so much so that the <i>DEFIANT</i> nearly shook itself apart when the engines were tested at full power. Ultimately, these design flaws, combined with the Borg threat becoming less urgent, led Starfleet to the decision to abandon the project and place the prototype in storage.</p>

				<h3>Service at Deep Space 9</h3>
				<p>After the U.S.S. <i>Odyssey</i> was destroyed in late 2370, Commander Benjamin Sisko, who served on the team that designed the <i>DEFIANT</i>, requested that the vessel be pulled out of storage and assigned to Deep Space 9 to counter a new threat of the Dominion. The vessel was officially launched in 2370, on stardate 47538.5, from the Antares Ship Yards. Arriving in early 2371, the <i>DEFIANT</i>'s first assignment was to attempt to convince the Founders of the Dominion that the Federation posed no threat to them. After a special amendment was made to the Treaty of Algeron, the Romulan Star Empire installed one of their cloaking devices aboard the vessel to aid in its mission, in exchange for any intelligence gained on the Dominion.</p>

				<p>DS9's chief of operations, Miles O'Brien, spent two weeks overhauling the <i>DEFIANT</i>'s structural integrity field to overcome the ship's design flaws.</p>

				<p>Later in 2371, Maquis operative Thomas Riker hijacked the <i>DEFIANT</i> and used it to attack several Cardassian targets. Commander Sisko was forced to travel to Cardassia Prime with Gul Dukat to help track down the vessel. Although Dukat initially wanted to destroy the <i>DEFIANT</i>, he agreed to release the vessel and the Maquis crew to Starfleet custody in exchange for the <i>DEFIANT</i>'s scans of the Orias system and Riker himself. After facing overwhelming opposition from Obsidian Order forces deployed from the Orias system, Riker ultimately surrendered and the <i>DEFIANT</i> was returned to DS9.</p>

				<p>After a joint Obsidian Order-Tal Shiar fleet entered the Gamma Quadrant on a mission to destroy the Founders' homeworld, Vice Admiral Toddman ordered that the <i>DEFIANT</i> remain at DS9 to protect the Bajoran sector from any Dominion retaliation. Despite these orders, Commander Sisko took the vessel into the Gamma Quadrant in order to rescue Odo and Elim Garak, who were being held on one of the Romulan vessels in the fleet. Even with sabotage of the cloaking device by security chief Lieutenant Commander Michael Eddington, the <i>DEFIANT</i> ultimately succeeded in its mission and returned to DS9. Admiral Toddman decided not to file charges against Sisko or any of the other officers who had joined him.</p>  
				<p>In late 2371, a Changeling posing as Federation ambassador Krajensky sent the <i>DEFIANT</i> on a patrol mission of the Federation-Tzenkethi border. During the mission, the Changeling sabotaged the <i>DEFIANT</i>, causing it to fly out of control towards a Tzenkethi colony that was intended to be attacked; the Dominion hoped it would provoke a second war between the two powers. The crew was eventually able to regain control of the vessel and kill the Changeling.</p> 

				<p>In early 2372, the <i>DEFIANT</i> fought its way through Cardassian space against Klingon forces - as the Federation was at war with the Klingons - to bring the Detapa Council to Deep Space 9. During this mission, the ship once briefly used its tractor beam as a 'substitute' shield to protect it from enemy fire, when it was forced to drop its usual deflector shields to beam the Council to safety. </p>

				<p>Several weeks later, the <i>DEFIANT</i> traveled to the Gamma Quadrant to meet with a Karemma starship. During the meeting, the two vessels were attacked by Jem'Hadar forces. The <i>DEFIANT</i> engaged the Jem'Hadar in the atmosphere of a gas giant and took severe damage; several of the senior officers were incapacitated. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander Worf, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was able to destroy the Jem'Hadar ships and rescue the Karemma.</p> 

				<p>In mid-2372, Commander Worf took the <i>DEFIANT</i> to Earth to assist Captain Sisko in foiling a plot by AdmiralLeyton which would have overthrown the Federation government and established martial law. While en route, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was forced to engage the USS Lakota under the command of Captain Erika Benteen, who was operating under the assumption that the <i>DEFIANT</i> was manned by Changelings. After a prolonged battle in which both ships took significant damage, the Lakota eventually stood down when Benteen conferred with Worf and Kira about her orders to stop the DEFIANT. Thus, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was allowed to continue to Earth with the evidence Sisko needed to stop the coup. </p>

				<p>During an escort mission where the <i>DEFIANT</i> was protecting several Cardassian freighters against Klingon raids, Commander Worf accidentally destroyed a Klingon civilian transport ship. The Klingon Empire requested that Worf be extradited to face justice for the ship's destruction, but was refused when it was determined that the transport ship had been unmanned.</p>
				
				<p>Following an attack on DS9 by Jem'Hadar rebels, the <i>DEFIANT</i> pursued their vessel into the Gamma Quadrant, and rescued the crew of a disabled Jem'Hadar fighter. The crews of the <i>DEFIANT</i> and the fighter then worked together to destroy an Iconian gateway that was under the control of the rebels.</p>
				
				<p>In late 2372, the <i>DEFIANT</i> took Odo to the Founder's new homeworld, where he was to be judged for killing the Krajensky changeling the previous year. The Female Changeling allowed the vessel to personally transport him to the Founder's homeworld, so long as one of her pilots entered the coordinates for the planet and wiped them from the ship's memory afterwards.</p>
				
				<p>In early 2373, the <i>DEFIANT</i> tractored a Jem'Hadar fighter captured by Captain Sisko back to Federation space.</p>
				
				<p>The <i>DEFIANT</i> was later transported to the 23rd century, where it encountered the original U.S.S. <i>Enterprise</i> visiting Deep Space K-7 in 2268. The <i>DEFIANT</i>'s crew stopped Arne Darvin from killing Captain James T. Kirk with a bomb implanted in a dead Tribble.</p>

				<p>While pursuing Maquis defector Michael Eddington, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was disabled by a cascade virus that Eddington had installed in the ship's computers during his time as DS9's Starfleet security chief. The vessel had to be towed back to DS9 by the U.S.S. <i>Malinche</i>. When that vessel was later disabled by the Maquis, Captain Sisko used the damaged <i>DEFIANT</i> to continue pursuing Eddington. After Sisko poisoned a Maquis planet, Eddington surrendered to Sisko and was incarcerated.</p>

				<h3>The DEFIANT fights the Borg</h3>
				<p>Under the command of Worf, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was finally used for what the vessel had originally been designed: fighting the Borg. In the Battle of Sector 001 in mid-2373, the <i>DEFIANT</i> assaulted an invading Borg cube from the Typhon sector to Earth and took severe damage. Worf was about to order the ship to ram the cube when the USS <i>Enterprise</i>-E rescued the vessel's survivors, leaving the <i>DEFIANT</i> unmoored though salvageable. Aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>-E, the <i>DEFIANT</i> and <i>Enterprise</i>-E crews followed a Borg sphere to 2063 shortly after the cube's destruction, to stop the Borg from sabotaging Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight. Following these events, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was repaired and returned to DS9. </p>

				<p>When the Dominion annexed the Cardassian Union and invaded the Alpha Quadrant, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was forced to destroy the runabout U.S.S. <i>Yukon</i>, which had been commandeered by a Changeling posing as Doctor Julian Bashir. The runabout was carrying a trilithium weapon which was to be detonated in the Bajoran sun, destroying the entire system.</p>

				<p>In an effort to stop the Dominion's military build-up in Cardassian space, Starfleet Command opted to mine the entrance to the Bajoran wormhole, a move that was virtually guaranteed to lead to war. Despite coming under fire by Dominion forces, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was able to successfully deploy the minefield and evacuate Deep Space 9's Starfleet personnel before the Dominion took control of the station.</p>

				<p>For the next several months, the <i>DEFIANT</i> fought as part of the Second Fleet, operating out of Starbase 375. When Captain Sisko was made an adjutant to Vice Admiral William Ross, Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax was assigned to captain the vessel. Under Dax's command, the <i>DEFIANT</i> destroyed a Dominion sensor array hidden in the Argolis Cluster.</p>
				
				<p>Sisko returned to the captain's chair of the <i>DEFIANT</i> to lead Operation Return in mid-2374. The vessel resumed its assignment at Deep Space 9 after the station was retaken. </p>
			
				<p>The DEFIANT was part of a search effort to look for survivors of the U.S.S. <i>Honshu</i>, after the latter vessel was destroyed by Cardassian forces. Upon completion of that mission, the ship was immediately assigned to escort a Federation troop convoy near the Badlands.</p>

				<p>While studying a subspace compression anomaly in mid-2374, the <i>DEFIANT</i> was taken over by Jem'Hadar forces. Thanks to the efforts of the <i>DEFIANT</i> crew combined with work by the U.S.S. <i>Rubicon</i>, the starship was retaken and the surviving Jem'Hadar were taken to a Federation prisoner of war camp.</p>

				<p>The <i>DEFIANT</i> rescued survivors from the U.S.S. <i>Valiant</i>, which likewise belonged to the DEFIANT-class, later that year.</p>
				<p>Upon completion of a convoy escort mission, the <i>DEFIANT</i> responded to a distress call from Captain Lisa Cusak, who was commanding the U.S.S. <i>Olympia</i>. The <i>Olympia</i> had crashed on an L-class planet in the Rutharian sector of the Beta Quadrant. Upon arrival at the planet, the <i>DEFIANT</i> crew found an energy barrier surrounding the planet which had carried Cusak's distress call forward through time; Cusak had been dead three years. Her body was taken back to DS9 and a memorial service was held for her by the crew. </p>


				<h3>The <i>DEFIANT</i> fights at Chin'toka</h3>
				<p>The <i>DEFIANT</i>, along with the I.K.S. <i>Rotarran</i>, led the Federation Alliance fleet at the First Battle of Chin'toka, in late 2374. The crew of the <i>DEFIANT</i> found a way to disable a deployment of Cardassian orbital weapon platforms protecting the Chin'toka system.</p>

				<p>Under Worf's command, the <i>DEFIANT</i> spent the next several months on convoy duty.</p>  
				<p>In early 2375, the <i>DEFIANT</i> made a supply run to AR-558, a planetoid in the Chin'toka system under heavy siege by the Jem'Hadar. The <i>DEFIANT</i> crew provided a small reinforcement of the planetoid and helped disable many houdinis that had been plaguing Federation troops stationed there.</p>
	
				
				<p>The <i>DEFIANT</i> later served as part of a search effort to look for survivors of the I.K.S. <i>Koraga</i>, which had been destroyed by Dominion forces in the Badlands. The <i>DEFIANT</i> managed to recover six escape pods, but was forced to call off its search for the <i>Koraga</i>'s captain, Worf, after only three days, due to heavy Jem'Hadar patrols in the area.</p>
				
				<h3>The destruction of the <i>DEFIANT</i></h3>
				<p>Later that year, the Dominion, along with new Breen allies, retook the Chin'toka system with the Second Battle of Chin'toka. The <i>DEFIANT</i> was among 311 ships destroyed in the battle. The U.S.S. <i>Sao Paulo</i> was assigned to DS9 to replace the <i>DEFIANT</i>, after its destruction. Captain Sisko was granted special dispensation by the Chief of Starfleet Operations to rename the <i>Sao Paulo</i> to "<i>DEFIANT</i>". </p>
